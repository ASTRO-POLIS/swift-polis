///
/// Note that some sites might only be open during part of the year (e.g. because of difficult winter conditions) or may only be visited during school vacations.
///
/// The first version of the the POLIS standard defines only an optional `note` string.  Future versions will add more structured types expressing numerical periods like:
///    Mo-Fr: 16:00-18:00h or
///    June - September
/// Currently this more natural representation could be achieved by formatting `note` using `\n` (new lines) and tabs.

//MARK: - Property Values -
// Basic idea - value is always a string that is converted (if possible) to a typed value.
/// An object that represents a value a value with an accompanying unit.
///
/// Examples include telescope apertures, instrument wavelengths, etc. POLIS only defines the means of recording measurements. Client applications using POLIS
/// should implement unit conversions (if needed). Currently, a POLIS provider is not expected to make any conversions, but it might check if the units are allowed.
///
/// Apple's Units types are not used here on purpose because of the lack of scientific accuracy and profound misunderstanding of how science works.
///
/// **Note:** This Measurement implementation is very rudimentary. It is a placeholder type. In future implementations, it will be replaced by external
/// implementations, capable of measurement computations and conversions.
