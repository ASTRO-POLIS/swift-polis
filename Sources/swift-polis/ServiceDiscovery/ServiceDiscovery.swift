//
// **Note for Swift developers:** COURAGEOUS and IMPORTANT ASSUMPTION - types defined in this file and in
// `ObservatorySiteDirectory.swift` should not have incompatible coding/decoding and API changes in future versions of
// the standard! All other types could (and will) evolve. And yes, I know this would be too good to be true ðŸ˜‚

/// Versions prior `1.0` could be ignored by production-ready implementations. It will be assumed, that they are
/// experimental.

//MARK: - POLIS Item Attributes -

///
/// Each POLIS type (Provider, Observing Site, Observatory, etc.) should include `PolisLifecycleStatus` (as part of
/// ``PolisItemAttributes``).
///
/// `PolisLifecycleStatus` will determine the syncing policy, as well as visibility of the POLIS items within
/// client implementations. Implementations should adopt following behaviours:
/// - `inactive`  - do not sync, but continue monitoring
/// - `active`    - must be synced and monitored
/// - `deleted`   - sync the `PolisItemAttributes` only to prevent new propagation of the record and to block the UUID
/// - `suspended` - sync the `PolisItemAttributes` only of the main records
/// - `unknown`   - do not sync, but continue monitoring
