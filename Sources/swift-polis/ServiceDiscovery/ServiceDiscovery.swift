// This file defines types related to the POLIS provider discovery and few reusable types that are building blocks of
// other POLIS types.
//
// **Note for Swift developers:** COURAGEOUS and IMPORTANT ASSUMPTION - types defined in this file and in
// `ObservatorySiteDirectory.swift` should not have incompatible coding/decoding and API changes in future versions of
// the standard! All other types could (and will) evolve. And yes, I know this would be too good to be true ðŸ˜‚

import Foundation

/// This is a list of all supported versions. A POLIS provider can support some of them or all of them. Only major and
/// minor version numbers are supported. Concrete implementations can ignore `patch numbers` and alfa / beta modifiers.
/// Versions prior `1.0` could be ignored by production-ready implementations. It will be assumed, that they are
/// experimental.
public let supportedPolisAPIVersions = [
    "0.1",    // Initial experimental version. Should not be used for production neither for API compatibility testing.

//MARK: - POLIS Item Attributes -

/// Each POLIS type (Provider, Observing Site, Observatory, etc.) should include `LifecycleStatus` (as part of
/// ``PolisItemAttributes``).
///
/// `LifecycleStatus` will determine the syncing policy, as well as visibility of the POLIS items within
/// client implementations. Implementations should adopt following behaviours:
/// - `inactive`  - do not sync, but continue monitoring
/// - `active`    - must be synced and monitored
/// - `deleted`   - sync the `Attributes` only to prevent new propagation of the record and to block the UUID
/// - `suspended` - sync the `Attributes` only the main records
/// - `unknown`   - do not sync, but continue monitoring
public enum LifecycleStatus: String, Codable {
    
    /// New, being edited, in process of upgrade providers should be marked as `inactive`.
    case inactive
    
    /// `active` marks a production provider that is publicly accessible.
    case active
    
    /// `deleted` is needed to prevent reappearance of disabled providers.
    case deleted
    
    /// `suspended` in cases of software or hardware migrations, or violations of standard compliance.
    case suspended
    
    /// `unknown` marks a provider with unknown status, and is mostly just for completeness.
    case unknown
}



/// `PolisItemAttributes` uniquely identifies and defines the status of almost every POLIS item and defines external
/// relationships to other items (or POLIS objects).
///
/// The idea of POLIS Attributes comes from analogous type that could be found in the `RTML` standard. The
/// RTML attributes  turned out to be extremely useful for relating items within one RTML document and linking RTML
/// documents to each other.
///
/// `PolisItemAttributes` are an essential part of (almost) every POLIS type. They are needed to uniquely identify and
/// describe each item (object) and establish parent-child relationships between them, as well as provide enough
/// informationIn for the syncing of polis providers.

/// corresponding type (Element).

//MARK: - POLIS Contact -
// Many POLIS types have reference to contact people (owners of sites, admins, project managers). Later we need to add

// just a simple contact to be able to communicate with site admins is enough.
//

///
/// The current list includes just few popular communication channels. Emerging apps like Signal and Telegram are not
/// currently included, nor local Chinese and Russian social media communication channels. If someone needs these channels,
/// please submit a pool request.
