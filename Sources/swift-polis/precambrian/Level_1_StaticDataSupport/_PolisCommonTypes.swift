// developer's nightmares. We think it's perhaps the best in the future to rely on an external implementation for address
// management.
// On the other hand the implementation of contact channels (in order to allow communication with POLIS providers site admins)
// is a simple enough task and therefore the current implementation of POLIS includes contact-only related types.

/// admin.
///
/// It is important to be able to contact the admin of a POLIS service provider or the admin or the owner of an
/// observing site, but one should not forget that all POLIS data is publicly available and therefore should not
/// expose private information if possible. It is preferable not to expose private email addresses, phone numbers, or
/// twitter accounts, but only publicly available organisation contacts or pages.
